The codes in the repository allows users to input their IDs from a game called Dota 2 and see their game histories. The GUI shows how well the user did in a number of
games and the character he/she used. When clicked on the heroes button, the GUI shows all characters in the game, and when clicked on the items button, the GUI
shows all the items in the game.
